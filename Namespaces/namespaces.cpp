// Namespaces
//
// Lets say we have to companies A and B having the same product name 
// Lets say the name is Newphone1
//
// Now we can individually identify them with their comp. 
// A::Newphone1
// B::Newphone1
//
// Similarly two libraries may have the same object 
// So we have namespaces equivalent to the company name and object 
// equivalent to the product name
//
// Example-
//
// cout is a object in the std namespace of the iostream library
// we reffer cout as std::cout to avoid any conflicts with other objects
// of any other library we might use further
//
